##ObMovement
---------------------

##Introduction
---------------------
ObMovement is my first attempt at building a Wordpress theme from the ground up (granted, using Underscores.me's excellent barebones theme). As such, it doesn't use Bootstrap or any other CSS framework, and it is pretty non-responsive, but it does feature a simple Jquery script that changes the color theme over time, for a slow moving color wheel effect as the user browses the site. It is intended to be used in Wordpress sites that are more of a web presence than an actual blog with discourse going on, so the comment system is effectively disabled in the theme. See ObMovement in production at the author's personal website: http://danwright.co!

##Requirements
---------------------
To use this you will need a webserver running Wordpress, as the official Wordpress hosting services do not allow you to upload your own themes.

##Instructions
---------------------
Using FTP, go ahead and upload the entire ObMovement directory into /public_html/wp-content/themes on your webserver. Now go to your Wordpress administration panel, go to Appearance, click on "Themes", and click the "Activate" button under the thumbnail image for ObMovement. Now you're ready to roll!
